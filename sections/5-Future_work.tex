\chapter{Future work}

The future work can be summarized as following points:\\
1) Get the data on DNA methylation and tumor somatic copy number variations. Based on the normal sample's genotype calling, perform a germline-based eQTL analysis of tumor expression, which considered the DNA methylation and tumor somatic copy number variations separately. This method might be able to give more information on the germline level. The potential inherited risk loci might be found.\\
2) Get a larger cohort to call somatic mutations intensively in order to get enough genotypes at the same mutated loci (around 50bp). Perform an eQTL analysis purely based on somatic mutations to reveal more driver mutations in ccRCC development. \\
3) Build online websites to visualize all the eQTL results, including information searching and figure generation based on queries.\\
4) Perform more pathway analysis and survival analysis based on existing eQTL results.
