	abstract = {Deubiquitinating enzymes are increasingly recognized to play important roles in cancer, with many acting as oncogenes or tumor suppressors. In this study, we employed a bioinformatics approach to screen for enzymes from this family involved in cancer and found USP24 as a potent predictor of poor outcomes in neuroblastoma, an aggressive childhood cancer. USP24 resides in a region commonly deleted in neuroblastoma, yet was independently associated with poor outcomes in this disease. Deletion of Usp24 in a murine model resulted in degradation of collapsin response mediator protein 2 (CRMP2), a regulator of axon growth, guidance, and neuronal polarity. Cells lacking USP24 had significant increases in spindle defects, chromosome missegregation, and aneuploidy, phenotypes that were rescued by the restoration of CRMP2. USP24 prevented aneuploidy by maintaining spindle-associated CRMP2, which is required for mitotic accuracy. Our findings further indicate that USP24 is a tumor suppressor that may play an important role in the pathogenesis of neuroblastoma.
Significance: This study identifies the chromosome instability gene USP24 as frequently deleted in neuroblastoma and provides important insight into the pathogenesis of this aggressive childhood cancer.},

	abstract = {The huge exopeptidase, tripeptidyl-peptidase II (TPP II), appears to be involved in a large number of important biological processes. It is present in the cytosol of most eukaryotic cells, where it removes tripeptides from free amino termini of longer peptides through a ‘molecular ruler mechanism’. Its main role appears to be general protein degradation, together with the proteasome. The activity is increased by stress, such as during starvation and muscle wasting, and in tumour cells. Overexpression of TPP II leads to accelerated cell growth, genetic instability and resistance to apoptosis, whereas inhibition or down-regulation of TPP II renders cells sensitive to apoptosis. Although it seems that humans can survive without TPP II, it is not without consequences. Recently, patients with loss-of-function mutations in the TPP2 gene have been identified. They suffer from autoimmunity leading to leukopenia and other consequences. Furthermore, a missense mutation in the TPP2 gene is associated with a sterile brain inflammation condition mimicking multiple sclerosis. This review will summarise what is known today regarding the activity and structure of this very large enzyme complex, and its potential function in various cellular processes. It is clear that more research is needed to identify natural substrates and/or interaction partners of TPP II, which can explain the observed effects in different cellular contexts.},

Ectopic overexpression of TMEM209 promoted cell growth, whereas TMEM209 attenuation was sufficient to block growth. Mass spectrometric analysis identified the nucleoporin protein NUP205 as a TMEM209-interacting protein, stabilizing NUP205 and increasing the level of c-Myc in the nucleus.

	abstract = {Alström syndrome (AS) is characterised by metabolic deficits, retinal dystrophy, sensorineural hearing loss, dilated cardiomyopathy and multi-organ fibrosis. Elucidating the function of the mutated gene, ALMS1, is critical for the development of specific treatments and may uncover pathways relevant to a range of other disorders including common forms of obesity and type 2 diabetes. Interest in ALMS1 is heightened by the recent discovery of its involvement in neonatal cardiomyocyte cell cycle arrest, a process with potential relevance to regenerative medicine. ALMS1 encodes a {\textasciitilde} 0.5 megadalton protein that localises to the base of centrioles. Some studies have suggested a role for this protein in maintaining centriole-nucleated sensory organelles termed primary cilia, and AS is now considered to belong to the growing class of human genetic disorders linked to ciliary dysfunction (ciliopathies). However, mechanistic details are lacking, and recent studies have implicated ALMS1 in several processes including endosomal trafficking, actin organisation, maintenance of centrosome cohesion and transcription. In line with a more complex picture, multiple isoforms of the protein likely exist and non-centrosomal sites of localisation have been reported. This review outlines the evidence for both ciliary and extra-ciliary functions of ALMS1.},

No characterization of its role in renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is yet available. In this study, PANTR1 expression was confined to human brain and kidney tissue and was found significantly up-regulated in clear-cell renal cell carcinoma tissue (ccRCC) compared to non-cancerous kidney tissue in two independent cohorts (p {\textless} 0.001 for both cohorts). In uni- and multivariate Cox regression analysis, ccRCC patients with higher levels of PANTR1 showed significantly poorer disease-free survival in our own respective cohort (n = 175, hazard ratio: 4.3, 95\% confidence interval: 1.45-12.75, p = 0.008) in accordance with significantly poorer overall survival in a large The Cancer Genome Atlas database (TCGA) cohort (n = 530, hazard ratio: 2.19, 95\% confidence interval: 1.59-3.03, p ≤ 0.001). To study the underlying cellular mechanisms mediated by varying levels of PANTR1 in kidney cancer cells, we applied siRNA-mediated knock-down experiments in three independent ccRCC cell lines (RCC-FG, RCC-MF, 769-P). A decrease in PANTR1 levels led to significantly reduced cellular growth through activation of apoptosis in all tested cell lines. Moreover, as angiogenesis is a critical driver in ccRCC pathogenesis, we identified that PANTR1 expression is critical for in vitro tube formation and endothelial cell migration (p {\textless} 0.05). On the molecular level, knock-down of PANTR1 led to a decrease in Vascular Endothelial growth factor A (VEGF-A) and cell adhesion molecule laminin subunit gamma-2 (LAMC2) expression, corroborated by a positive correlation in RCC tissue (for VEGF-A R = 0.19, p {\textless} 0.0001, for LAMC2 R = 0.13, p = 0.0028). In conclusion, this study provides first evidence that PANTR1 has a relevant role in human RCC by influencing apoptosis and angiogenesis.},

This study investigates the role of LAMC2 in epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and angiogenesis in CCA and explores the underlying mechanism(s). Differentially expressed genes related to CCA were initially screened using a microarray analysis, and the interaction between LAMC2 and the EGFR signaling pathway was identified. To determine the regulatory effects of LAMC2 on CCA progression, LAMC2 was silenced or overexpressed and the EGFR signaling pathway was activated or blocked. Subsequently, the regulation effects of LAMC2 were evaluated on the expression of EMT markers, invasion and migration of CCA cells, as well as microvessel density in nude mice. Microarray analysis demonstrated that highly expressed LAMC2 is linked to CCA development, which involves the EGFR signaling pathway. When LAMC2 expression was increased, the EGFR signaling pathway and EMT were activated in CCA tissues. Silencing of LAMC2 as well as EGFR signaling pathway inhibition led to suppression of EMT, cell invasion, and migration abilities in vitro, as well as angiogenesis in vivo. This study demonstrates that LAMC2 silencing suppresses the activity of the EGFR signaling pathway, thus functioning as a tumor suppressor in CCA.},

Loss of regulation by protein ubiquitination leads to various diseases, such as cancer. Two types of enzymes, namely, E1/E2/E3 ligases and deubiquitinases, are responsible for controlling protein ubiquitination. The ubiquitin-specific peptidases (USPs) are the main members of the deubiquitinase family. Many studies have addressed the roles of USPs in various diseases. An increasing number of studies have indicated that USPs are critical for cancer progression, and some USPs have been used as targets to develop inhibitors for cancer prevention.

	abstract = {X-ray radiation resistance associated 1 (XRRA1) has been found to regulate the response of human tumor and normal cells to X-radiation (XR). Although XRRA1 overexpression is known to be involved in cancer cell response to XR, there are no reports about whether the expression of XRRA1 in tumors can adjust radioresistance. It is widely known that cell cycle arrest could cause radioresistance. We found that blocked XRRA1 expression could lead to cell cycle G2/M arrest by the regulation of cyclin A, cyclin E, and p21 proteins in colorectal cancer (CRC) and expression of XRRA1 reduced cell cycle arrest and increased cell proliferation in CRC. However, whether regulation of the cell cycle by XRRA1 can influence radioresistance is poorly characterized. Correspondingly, DNA repair can effectively lead to radioresistance. In our study, when cancer cells were exposed to drugs and ionizing radiation, low expression of XRRA1 could increase the phosphorylation of DNA repair pathway factors CHK1, CHK2, and ATM and reduce the expression of γ-H2AX, which is believed to participate in DNA repair in the nucleus. Crucially, our results identify a novel link between XRRA1 and the ATM/CHK1/2 pathway and suggest that XRRA1 is involved in a DNA damage response that drives radio- and chemoresistance by regulating the ATM/CHK1/2 pathway.},

	abstract = {Ribosomal proteins have emerged as novel regulators of the Mdm2-p53 feedback loop, especially in the context of ribosomal stress. RPS26 is a recently identified Diamond-Blackfan Anemia-related ribosomal protein and its role in p53 activation has not been previously explored. In this study we found knockdown of RPS26 induced p53 stabilization and activation via a RPL11-dependent mechanism, resulting in p53-dependent cell growth inhibition. Moreover, RPS26 has the ability to interact with Mdm2 and inhibits Mdm2-mediated p53 ubiquitination that leads to p53 stabilization upon overexpression. Importantly, we discovered that RPS26 knockdown impaired p53’s ability to transcriptionally activate its target genes in response to DNA damage, without affecting its stability. Accordingly, the cells lost the ability to induce G2/M cell cycle arrest. We further found that upon RPS26 knockdown, the DNA damage induced recruitment of p53 to the promoters of its target genes and p53 acetylation were both greatly reduced. In addition, RPS26 can interact with p53 independent of Mdm2 and coexist in a complex with p53 and p300. These data establish a role of RPS26 in DNA damage response by directly influencing p53 transcriptional activity, and suggest that RPS26 acts distinctively in different scenarios of p53 activation. Our finding also implicates p53 transcriptional activity control as an important mechanism of p53 regulation by ribosomal proteins.},

The results of the present study revealed that the expression of the lncRNA, TRIM52‑AS1, was downregulated in RCC, which was demonstrated using reverse transcription‑quantitative polymerase chain reaction analysis. Furthermore, the effects of TRIM52‑AS1 on proliferation, cell migration and apoptosis were analyzed using a wound scratch assay, a 3‑(4,5‑dimethylthiazol‑2yl)‑2,5‑diphenyl tetrazolium bromide assay and flow cytometric analysis, respectively. The overexpression of TRIM52‑AS1 using a synthesized vector significantly suppressed cell migration and proliferation, and induced apoptosis of the RCC cells in vitro, and interference of its expression led to the opposite effects. The present study was the first, to the best of our knowledge, to demonstrate that TRIM52‑AS1 functions as a tumor suppressor in RCC. Further investigation is required to elucidate the molecular mechanisms underlying the effects of TRIM52-AS1 in the development of RCC.},

Here, we review oncogenic and oncosuppressive miRNAs, their putative target genes, and the crucial pathways they are involved in. The contradictory behavior of a number of miRNAs, such as suppressive and anti-metastatic miRNAs with oncogenic potential (for example, miR-99a, miR-106a, miR-125b, miR-144, miR-203, miR-378), is examined. miRNAs that contribute mostly to important pathways and processes in ccRCC, for instance, PI3K/AKT/mTOR, Wnt-β, histone modification, and chromatin remodeling, are discussed in detail. We also separately consider their participation in crucial oncogenic processes, such as hypoxia and angiogenesis, metastasis, and epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT). The review also considers the interactions of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and miRNAs of significance in ccRCC. Recent advances in the understanding of the role of hypermethylated miRNA genes in ccRCC and their usefulness as biomarkers are reviewed based on our own data and those available in the literature. Finally, new data and perspectives concerning the clinical applications of miRNAs in the diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment of ccRCC are discussed.},

	abstract = {BACKGROUND: Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) is a fatal disease, in which the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway serves an important role in the tumorigenesis.  Previous studies have reported the prognostic significance of PI3K/AKT/mTOR  signaling pathway members in RCC; however, there is insufficient evidence to date to  confirm this. Thus, the present study aimed to systematically investigate the  prognostic roles of multiple PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling proteins in clear cell RCC  (ccRCC) using online large-scale databases. METHODS: The mRNA expression profiles of  PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway proteins PTEN, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3CD, PIK3CG, AKT1,  AKT2, AKT3 and mTOR were investigated using the Gene Expression Profiling  Interactive Analysis (GEPIA) and Oncomine databases, and the protein expression  levels of PI3K, AKT and mTOR were detected using western blotting (WB) analysis. In  addition, the correlation between mRNA or protein expression levels and the  prognostic significance was analyzed using the Kaplan-Meier (K-M) plotter (n = 530),  the Human Protein Atlas (HPA; n = 528) and The Cancer Protein Atlas (TCPA; n = 445)  databases. RESULTS: The GEPIA revealed that the mRNA expression of major  PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway members, including PTEN, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3,  were negatively correlated with ccRCC stages (P {\textless} 0.05), though most of their mRNA  and protein expression levels were notsignificantly different between ccRCC and  normal tissues using GEPIA, Oncomine and WB analyses (P {\textless} 0.05). Meanwhile, using  the K-M plotter and HPA prognostic analysis, it was found that the mRNA expression  levels of the majority of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway members, including  PTEN, PIK3CA, PIK3CB, PIK3CG, AKT3 and mTOR were positively correlated with overall  survival (OS), whereas PIK3CD mRNA expression was negatively correlated with OS  (P {\textless} 0.05). Furthermore, TCPA prognostic analysis observed that several of the key  molecules of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway [PTEN, p-AKT (S473) and p-mTOR  (S2448)] were also positively correlated with OS in patients with ccRCC (P {\textless} 0.05).  In conclusion, the present study suggested that several members of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR  signaling pathway, especially PTEN, may be favorable prognostic factors in ccRCC,  which indicated that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR signaling pathway may be implicated in ccRCC  initiation and progression.},

	abstract = {We describe a new computer program, SnpEff, for rapidly categorizing the effects of variants in genome sequences. Once a genome is sequenced, SnpEff annotates variants  based on their genomic locations and predicts coding effects. Annotated genomic  locations include intronic, untranslated region, upstream, downstream, splice site,  or intergenic regions. Coding effects such as synonymous or non-synonymous amino  acid replacement, start codon gains or losses, stop codon gains or losses, or frame  shifts can be predicted. Here the use of SnpEff is illustrated by annotating  {\textasciitilde}356,660 candidate SNPs in {\textasciitilde}117 Mb unique sequences, representing a substitution  rate of {\textasciitilde}1/305 nucleotides, between the Drosophila melanogaster w(1118); iso-2;  iso-3 strain and the reference y(1); cn(1) bw(1) sp(1) strain. We show that {\textasciitilde}15,842  SNPs are synonymous and {\textasciitilde}4,467 SNPs are non-synonymous (N/S {\textasciitilde}0.28). The remaining  SNPs are in other categories, such as stop codon gains (38 SNPs), stop codon losses  (8 SNPs), and start codon gains (297 SNPs) in the 5'UTR. We found, as expected, that  the SNP frequency is proportional to the recombination frequency (i.e., highest in  the middle of chromosome arms). We also found that start-gain or stop-lost SNPs in  Drosophila melanogaster often result in additions of N-terminal or C-terminal amino  acids that are conserved in other Drosophila species. It appears that the 5' and 3'  UTRs are reservoirs for genetic variations that changes the termini of proteins  during evolution of the Drosophila genus. As genome sequencing is becoming  inexpensive and routine, SnpEff enables rapid analyses of whole-genome sequencing  data to be performed by an individual laboratory.},

Many existing genetic-analysis tools are not  designed to handle such large data sets in a convenient manner and do not  necessarily exploit the new opportunities that whole-genome data bring. To address  these issues, we developed PLINK, an open-source C/C++ WGAS tool set. With PLINK,  large data sets comprising hundreds of thousands of markers genotyped for thousands  of individuals can be rapidly manipulated and analyzed in their entirety. As well as  providing tools to make the basic analytic steps computationally efficient, PLINK  also supports some novel approaches to whole-genome data that take advantage of  whole-genome coverage. We introduce PLINK and describe the five main domains of  function: data management, summary statistics, population stratification,  association analysis, and identity-by-descent estimation. In particular, we focus on  the estimation and use of identity-by-state and identity-by-descent information in  the context of population-based whole-genome studies. This information can be used  to detect and correct for population stratification and to identify extended  chromosomal segments that are shared identical by descent between very distantly  related individuals. Analysis of the patterns of segmental sharing has the potential  to map disease loci that contain multiple rare variants in a population-based  linkage analysis.},

	abstract = {Defining mechanisms that generate intratumour heterogeneity and branched evolution may inspire novel therapeutic approaches to limit tumour diversity and adaptation. SETD2 (Su(var), Enhancer of zeste, Trithorax-domain containing 2) trimethylates histone-3 lysine-36 (H3K36me3) at sites of active transcription and is mutated in diverse tumour types, including clear cell renal carcinomas (ccRCCs). Distinct SETD2 mutations have been identified in spatially separated regions in ccRCC, indicative of intratumour heterogeneity. In this study, we have addressed the consequences of SETD2 loss-of-function through an integrated bioinformatics and functional genomics approach. We find that bi-allelic SETD2 aberrations are not associated with microsatellite instability in ccRCC. SETD2 depletion in ccRCC cells revealed aberrant and reduced nucleosome compaction and chromatin association of the key replication proteins minichromosome maintenance complex component (MCM7) and DNA polymerase δ hindering replication fork progression, and failure to load lens epithelium-derived growth factor and the Rad51 homologous recombination repair factor at DNA breaks. Consistent with these data, we observe chromosomal breakpoint locations are biased away from H3K36me3 sites in SETD2 wild-type ccRCCs relative to tumours with bi-allelic SETD2 aberrations and that H3K36me3-negative ccRCCs display elevated DNA damage in vivo. These data suggest a role for SETD2 in maintaining genome integrity through nucleosome stabilization, suppression of replication stress and the coordination of DNA repair.},

To address this knowledge gap, we analysed 115 multiregion tumour samples collected from 15 treatment-naïve patients pre- and post-nivolumab therapy, and at autopsy in three patients. We performed whole-exome sequencing, RNAseq, TCRseq, multiplex immunofluorescence and flow cytometry analyses and correlated with clinical response. We observed pre-treatment intratumoural TCR clonal expansions suggesting pre-existing immunity. Nivolumab maintained pre-treatment expanded, clustered TCR clones in responders, suggesting ongoing antigen-driven stimulation of T-cells. T-cells in responders were enriched for expanded TCF7+CD8+ T-cells and upregulated GZMK/B upon nivolumab-binding. By contrast, nivolumab promoted accumulation of new TCR clones in non-responders, replacing pre-treatment expanded clonotypes. In this dataset, mutational features did not correlate with response to nivolumab and human endogenous retrovirus expression correlated indirectly. Our data suggests that nivolumab potentiates clinical responses in ccRCC by binding pre-existing expanded CD8+ T-cells to enhance cytotoxicity.Competing Interest StatementL.A. is funded by the Royal Marsden Cancer Charity.

	abstract = {Renal cell carcinoma (RCC) incidence is highest in highly developed countries and it is the seventh most common neoplasm diagnosed. RCC management include nephrectomy  and targeted therapies. Type 1 insulin-like growth factor (IGF-1) pathway plays an  important role in cell proliferation and apoptosis resistance. IGF-1 and insulin  share overlapping downstream signaling pathways in normal and cancer cells. IGF-1  receptor (IGF1R) stimulation may promote malignant transformation promoting cell  proliferation, dedifferentiation and inhibiting apoptosis. Clear cell renal cell  carcinoma (ccRCC) patients with IGF1R overexpression have 70 \% increased risk of  death compared to patients who had tumors without IGF1R expression. IGF1R signaling  deregulation may results in p53, WT, BRCA1, VHL loss of function. RCC cells with  high expression of IGF1R are more resistant to chemotherapy than cells with low  expression. Silencing of IGF1R increase the chemosensitivity of ccRCC cells and the  effect is greater in VHL mutated cells. Understanding the role of IGF-1 signaling  pathway in RCC may result in development of new targeted therapeutic interventions.  First preclinical attempts with anti-IGF-1R monoclonal antibodies or fragment  antigen-binding (Fab) fragments alone or in combination with an mTOR inhibitor were  shown to inhibit in vitro growth and reduced the number of colonies formed by of RCC  cells.},

	abstract = {Studies have confirmed the relationship between dysregulated long noncoding RNAs and melanoma pathogenesis. However, the regulatory functions of long intergenic non-protein coding RNA 1291 (LINC01291) in melanoma remain unknown. Therefore, we evaluated LINC01291 expression in melanoma and explored its roles in regulating tumor behaviors. Further, the molecular events via which LINC01291 affects melanoma cells were investigated. LINC01291 expression in melanoma cells was analyzed using The Cancer Genome Atlas database and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction. Functional assays, including the Cell Counting Kit-8 assay, colony formation assay, flow cytometry, cell migration and invasion assays, and tumor xenograft models, were used to examine LINC01291’s role in melanoma cells. Additionally, bioinformatics analysis, RNA immunoprecipitation, luciferase reporter assay, and western blotting were conducted to determine the tumor-promoting mechanism of LINC01291. LINC01291 was upregulated in melanoma tissues and cell lines. Following LINC01291 knockdown, cell proliferation, colony formation, migration, and invasion were diminished, whereas apoptosis was enhanced and the cell cycle was arrested at G0/G1. In addition, loss of LINC01291 decreased the chemoresistance of melanoma cells to cisplatin. Furthermore, LINC01291 interference inhibited melanoma tumor growth in vivo. Mechanistically, LINC01291 functions as a competing endogenous RNA by sponging microRNA-625-5p (miR-625-5p) in melanoma cells and maintaining insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (IGF-1R) expression. Rescue experiments revealed that the roles induced by LINC01291 depletion in melanoma cells could be reversed by suppressing miR-625-5p or overexpressing IGF-1R. Our study identified the LINC01291/miR-625-5p/IGF-1R competing endogenous RNA pathway in melanoma cells, which may represent a novel diagnostic biomarker and an effective therapeutic target for melanoma.},

	doi = {10.1038/ki.2009.296},
	abstract = {The basic biology underlying the development of clear-cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) is critically dependent on the von Hippel-Lindau gene (VHL), whose protein  product is important in the cell's normal response to hypoxia. Aberrations in VHL's  function, either through mutation or promoter hypermethylation, lead to accumulation  of the transcriptional regulatory molecule, hypoxia-inducible factor alpha  (HIFalpha). HIFalpha can then dimerize with HIFbeta and translocate to the nucleus,  where it will transcriptionally upregulate a series of hypoxia-responsive genes,  including vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), platelet-derived growth factor  (PDGF), and others. Binding of these ligands to their cognate receptors activates a  series of kinase- dependent signaling pathways, including the RAF-MEK-ERK and  phosphatidylinositol-3 kinase-AKT-mTOR pathways. Targeted agents developed and now  approved for use in advanced ccRCC include humanized monoclonal antibodies against  VEGF, small-molecule tyrosine kinase inhibitors, and inhibitors of mTOR.  Understanding the biology of ccRCC is critical in understanding the current therapy  for the disease and in developing novel therapeutics in the future. This review will  provide an overview of the genetics of ccRCC, with an emphasis on how this has  informed the development of the targeted therapeutics for this disease.},

Here we perform an integrative analysis of  930 tumor whole genomes and matched transcriptomes, identifying a network of 193  noncoding loci in which mutations disrupt target gene expression. These 'somatic  eQTLs' (expression quantitative trait loci) are frequently mutated in specific  cancer tissues, and the majority can be validated in an independent cohort of 3,382  tumors. Among these, we find that the effects of noncoding mutations on DAAM1, MTG2  and HYI transcription are recapitulated in multiple cancer cell lines and that  increasing DAAM1 expression leads to invasive cell migration. Collectively, the  noncoding loci converge on a set of core pathways, permitting a classification of  tumors into pathway-based subtypes. The somatic eQTL network is disrupted in 88\% of  tumors, suggesting widespread impact of noncoding mutations in cancer.},

Twenty-one genes showed single or cross-cancer associations, including novel associations of SDHA in melanoma and PALB2 in stomach adenocarcinoma. The 659 predisposition variants and 18 additional large deletions in tumor suppressors, including ATM, BRCA1, and NF1, showed low gene expression and frequent (43\%) loss of heterozygosity or biallelic two-hit events. We also discovered 33 such variants in oncogenes, including missenses in MET, RET, and PTPN11 associated with high gene expression. We nominated 47 additional predisposition variants from prioritized VUSs supported by multiple evidences involving case-control frequency, loss of heterozygosity, expression effect, and co-localization with mutations and modified residues. Our integrative approach links rare predisposition variants to functional consequences, informing future guidelines of variant classification and germline genetic testing in cancer.},

The availability of the human genome sequence led us to propose that systematic  resequencing of cancer genomes for mutations would lead to the discovery of many  additional cancer genes. Here we report more than 1,000 somatic mutations found in  274 megabases (Mb) of DNA corresponding to the coding exons of 518 protein kinase  genes in 210 diverse human cancers. There was substantial variation in the number  and pattern of mutations in individual cancers reflecting different exposures, DNA  repair defects and cellular origins. Most somatic mutations are likely to be  'passengers' that do not contribute to oncogenesis. However, there was evidence for  'driver' mutations contributing to the development of the cancers studied in  approximately 120 genes. Systematic sequencing of cancer genomes therefore reveals  the evolutionary diversity of cancers and implicates a larger repertoire of cancer  genes than previously anticipated.},

Optionally, these factors can be interpreted as pathway or  transcription factor activations by providing prior information about which genes  are involved in the pathway or targeted by the factor. The inferred factors are used  in genetic association analyses. First, they are treated as additional covariates,  and are included in the model to increase detection power for mapping expression  traits.

The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project has been expanded over time, and, looking at the final data in version 8, Aguet et al. present a deep characterization of genetic associations and gene expression and splicing in 838 individuals over 49 tissues (see the Perspective by Wilson). This large study was able to characterize the details underlying many aspects of gene expression and provides a resource with which to better understand the fundamental molecular mechanisms of how genetic variants affect gene regulation and complex traits in humans.Science, this issue p. 1318; see also p. 1298The Genotype-Tissue Expression (GTEx) project was established to characterize genetic effects on the transcriptome across human tissues and to link these regulatory mechanisms to trait and disease associations. Here, we present analyses of the version 8 data, examining 15,201 RNA-sequencing samples from 49 tissues of 838 postmortem donors. We comprehensively characterize genetic associations for gene expression and splicing in cis and trans, showing that regulatory associations are found for almost all genes, and describe the underlying molecular mechanisms and their contribution to allelic heterogeneity and pleiotropy of complex traits. Leveraging the large diversity of tissues, we provide insights into the tissue specificity of genetic effects and show that cell type composition is a key factor in understanding gene regulatory mechanisms in human tissues.},

	abstract = {Next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) projects, such as the 1000 Genomes Project, are already revolutionizing our understanding of genetic variation among individuals.  However, the massive data sets generated by NGS--the 1000 Genome pilot alone  includes nearly five terabases--make writing feature-rich, efficient, and robust  analysis tools difficult for even computationally sophisticated individuals. Indeed,  many professionals are limited in the scope and the ease with which they can answer  scientific questions by the complexity of accessing and manipulating the data  produced by these machines. Here, we discuss our Genome Analysis Toolkit (GATK), a  structured programming framework designed to ease the development of efficient and  robust analysis tools for next-generation DNA sequencers using the functional  programming philosophy of MapReduce. The GATK provides a small but rich set of data  access patterns that encompass the majority of analysis tool needs. Separating  specific analysis calculations from common data management infrastructure enables us  to optimize the GATK framework for correctness, stability, and CPU and memory  efficiency and to enable distributed and shared memory parallelization. We highlight  the capabilities of the GATK by describing the implementation and application of  robust, scale-tolerant tools like coverage calculators and single nucleotide  polymorphism (SNP) calling. We conclude that the GATK programming framework enables  developers and analysts to quickly and easily write efficient and robust NGS tools,  many of which have already been incorporated into large-scale sequencing projects  like the 1000 Genomes Project and The Cancer Genome Atlas.},

Currently available RNA-seq aligners suffer from high mapping error  rates, low mapping speed, read length limitation and mapping biases. RESULTS: To  align our large ({\textgreater}80 billon reads) ENCODE Transcriptome RNA-seq dataset, we  developed the Spliced Transcripts Alignment to a Reference (STAR) software based on  a previously undescribed RNA-seq alignment algorithm that uses sequential maximum  mappable seed search in uncompressed suffix arrays followed by seed clustering and  stitching procedure. STAR outperforms other aligners by a factor of {\textgreater}50 in mapping  speed, aligning to the human genome 550 million 2 × 76 bp paired-end reads per hour  on a modest 12-core server, while at the same time improving alignment sensitivity  and precision. In addition to unbiased de novo detection of canonical junctions,  STAR can discover non-canonical splices and chimeric (fusion) transcripts, and is  also capable of mapping full-length RNA sequences. Using Roche 454 sequencing of  reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction amplicons, we experimentally  validated 1960 novel intergenic splice junctions with an 80-90\% success rate,  corroborating the high precision of the STAR mapping strategy.

And, there are currently 14 known RCC  germline variants that have been reproducibly shown to be associated with RCC risk.  However, the association of germline genetics with tumor genetics and clinical  aggressiveness are unknown. METHODS: We analyzed 420 ccRCC patients from The Cancer  Genome Atlas. Molecular subtype was determined based on acquired mutations in BAP1,  PBRM1, SETD2 and VHL. Aggressive subtype was defined clinically using Mayo SSIGN  score and molecularly using the ccA/ccB gene expression subtype.  Publically-available Hi-C data were used to link germline risk variants with  candidate target genes. RESULTS: The 8q24 variant rs35252396 was significantly  associated with VHL mutation status (OR = 1.6, p = 0.0037) and SSIGN score  (OR = 1.9, p = 0.00094), after adjusting for multiple comparisons. We observed that,  while some germline variants have interactions with nearby genes, some variants  demonstrate long-range interactions with target genes. CONCLUSIONS: These data  further demonstrate the link between rs35252396, HIF pathway and ccRCC clinical  aggressiveness, providing a more comprehensive picture of how germline genetics and  tumor genetics interact with respect to tumor development and progression.},

The pathogenesis of renal cell cancer remains poorly understood. Many of the tumor suppressor genes, oncogenes, and dysregulated pathways in ccRCC need to be revealed for improvement of the overall clinical outlook of the disease. Here, we developed a systems biology approach to prioritize the somatic mutated genes that lead to dysregulation of pathways in ccRCC. The method integrated multi-layer information to infer causative mutations and disease genes. First, we identified differential gene modules in ccRCC by coupling transcriptome and protein-protein interactions. Each of these modules consisted of interacting genes that were involved in similar biological processes and their combined expression alterations were significantly associated with disease type. Then, subsequent gene module-based eQTL analysis revealed somatic mutated genes that had driven the expression alterations of differential gene modules. Our study yielded a list of candidate disease genes, including several known ccRCC causative genes such as BAP1 and PBRM1, as well as novel genes such as NOD2, RRM1, CSRNP1, SLC4A2, TTLL1 and CNTN1. The differential gene modules and their driver genes revealed by our study provided a new perspective for understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the disease. Moreover, we validated the results in independent ccRCC patient datasets. Our study provided a new method for prioritizing disease genes and pathways.},

	abstract = {Considerable progress has been made in the treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma, with innovative surgical and systemic strategies revolutionising the  management of this disease. In localised disease, partial nephrectomy for small  tumours and radical nephrectomy for large tumours continue to be the gold-standard  treatments, with emphasis on approaches that have reduced invasiveness and preserve  renal function. Additionally, cytoreductive nephrectomy is often indicated before  the start of systemic treatment in patients with metastatic disease as part of  integrated management strategy. The effectiveness of immunotherapy, although  previously widely used for treatment of metastatic renal cell carcinoma, is still  controversial, and is mainly reserved for patients with good prognostic factors.  Development of treatments that have specific targets in relevant biological pathways  has been the main advance in treatment. Targeted drugs, including inhibitors of the  vascular endothelial growth factor and mammalian target of rapamycin pathways, have  shown robust effectiveness and offer new therapeutic options for the patients with  metastatic disease.},

	abstract = {MOTIVATION: Expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) analysis links variations in gene expression levels to genotypes. For modern datasets, eQTL analysis is a  computationally intensive task as it involves testing for association of billions of  transcript-SNP (single-nucleotide polymorphism) pair. The heavy computational burden  makes eQTL analysis less popular and sometimes forces analysts to restrict their  attention to just a small subset of transcript-SNP pairs. As more transcripts and  SNPs get interrogated over a growing number of samples, the demand for faster tools  for eQTL analysis grows stronger. RESULTS: We have developed a new software for  computationally efficient eQTL analysis called Matrix eQTL. In tests on large  datasets, it was 2-3 orders of magnitude faster than existing popular tools for  QTL/eQTL analysis, while finding the same eQTLs. The fast performance is achieved by  special preprocessing and expressing the most computationally intensive part of the  algorithm in terms of large matrix operations. Matrix eQTL supports additive linear  and ANOVA models with covariates, including models with correlated and  heteroskedastic errors. The issue of multiple testing is addressed by calculating  false discovery rate; this can be done separately for cis- and trans-eQTLs.},

	abstract = {Somatic mutations drive the growth of tumor cells and are pivotal biomarkers for many cancer treatments. Genetic association analysis using somatic mutations is an  effective approach to study the functional impact of somatic mutations. However,  standard regression methods are not appropriate for somatic mutation association  studies because somatic mutation calls often have non-ignorable false positive rate  and/or false negative rate. While large scale association analysis using somatic  mutations becomes feasible recently-thanks for the improvement of sequencing  techniques and the reduction of sequencing cost-there is an urgent need for a new  statistical method designed for somatic mutation association analysis. We propose  such a method with computationally efficient software implementation: Somatic  mutation Association test with Measurement Errors (SAME). SAME accounts for somatic  mutation calling uncertainty using a likelihood based approach. It can be used to  assess the associations between continuous/dichotomous outcomes and individual  mutations or gene-level mutations. Through simulation studies across a wide range of  realistic scenarios, we show that SAME can significantly improve statistical power  than the naive generalized linear model that ignores mutation calling uncertainty.  Finally, using the data collected from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project, we  apply SAME to study the associations between somatic mutations and gene expression  in 12 cancer types, as well as the associations between somatic mutations and colon  cancer subtype defined by DNA methylation data. SAME recovered some interesting  findings that were missed by the generalized linear model. In addition, we  demonstrated that mutation-level and gene-level analyses are often more appropriate  for oncogene and tumor-suppressor gene, respectively.},
